## Current people in the lab

**Ian Dworkin:** Is an associate professor in the Department of Biology <a href= "https://www.biology.mcmaster.ca/ "> at McMaster University </a>. Ian was previously a professor in the [Department of Integrative Biology](https://integrativebiology.natsci.msu.edu) at Michigan State University before moving back to Canada. When not doing the science thing, I do the dad thing. In the few spare moments, I also do some nerdy things (movies, video games, cooking, hiking). Favourite cheese is a really good Oka. Also old cheddar. And Jarslberg. Ok, I just really like cheese. Please contact me at dworkin "AT" mcmaster "DOT" ca.


**Sarah Marzec:** Is a Ph.D Student who is using Waddington's classic system studying genetic assimilation in *Drosophila melanogaster* to address questions about canalization, cryptic genetic variation and trait evolution by genetic assimilation. Sarah's is secretly hoping for a small lab accident that will result in her getting superpowers.


**Maria Pesevski:** Is a Ph.D student interested in the evolution of condition dependence and sexual dimorphism for size and shape using *Drosophila* wing morphology. When not thinking deeply about size, shape and sexual differences in flies, Maria spends her time salsa dancing.


**Katie Pelletier:** Is a Ph. D student interested in evolutionary genetics of complex phenotypes. Katie is identifying genetic variants influencing Drosophila wing size and shape within and between adaptively diverged populations and plans to use this to address questions about possible developmental and genetic biases that might influence the evolutionary process. Katie enjoys doing physical activities that inevitably lead to knee injuries.


**Andrew Scott:** Is a Ph. D student (jointly supervised by Reuven Dukas and Ian Dworkin) studying the evolution of complex social behaviours including aggregation behaviour. Andrew uses a combination of genetics, artificial selection and genomics to identify genes that contribute to variation for these social behaviours. When he is not developing new little devices to measure flies with, he is enjoying many of the local beers in Hamilton.


**Audrey Wilson:** Audrey is a M.Sc. student studying a potential mechanism that may contribute to the early evolution of sexually selected weapons, using experimental evolution in *Drosophila melanogaster*. By manipulating the spatial environment in specific ways, Audrey is determining the degree to which this can contribute to increased one-on-one contests for access to mates, and whether this in turn will increase sexual dimorphism of key traits. Because of the experiments that she does, Audrey's work space looks a lot like a craft store, and spends a considerable amount of time in the dollar store to find just the right materials to be converted to usable scientific "equipment".

**Darcy Henderson:** Darcy is a M.Sc. student studying the extent to which genetic interactions (epistasis) between pairs of mutations depends upon both how much the individual mutations perturb the phenotype (their magnitude) and the wild type genetic background in which the mutations are examined. When not setting up crosses, or hitting a puck, she likes watching controversial films and shows on netflix.

**Isabella Delano:** Isabella is an undergraduae thesis student studying the genetic basis of adaptive differentiation in wing size and shape between altitudinally varying populations of Drosophila.

**Dan Siemon:** Dan is an undergraduae thesis student studying the genetic basis of adaptive differentiation in wing size and shape between altitudinally varying populations of Drosophila. (Working in parallel with Isabella. it is a big project!)

**Megan Simoes:** Megan is an undergraduae thesis student studying  the evolution of sex specific condition dependence among species of Drosophila.

## Lab alumni

**Caitlyn Daley:** Caitlyn finished her M.Sc. in December 2019. Caitlyn studied the extent to which genetic background dependence of mutations were similar for mutations within and between genes throughout a gene regulatory network that influences *Drosophila* wing development. She really loves her cat.

**Paul Knoops:** Paul did his M.Sc. research studying how Drosophila interacted with potential predators, and how this influenced Drosophila mating behaviour and activity. Paul also made sure we never had any leftovers for lab parties.

**Nick Testa:** Nick did his Ph.D studying the genetics of sexual size and shape dimorphism in Drosophila. Data-wiz.
