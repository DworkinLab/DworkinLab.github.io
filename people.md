## Current people in the lab

**Ian Dworkin:** Is a professor in the Department of Biology <a href= "https://www.biology.mcmaster.ca/ "> at McMaster University </a> .Ian was previously a professor in the [Department of Integrative Biology](https://integrativebiology.natsci.msu.edu) at Michigan State University before moving back to Canada. When not doing the science thing, I do the dad thing. In the few spare moments, I also do nerdy things (movies, video games, cooking, hiking). Favourite cheese is a really good Oka. Also old cheddar. And Jarslberg. Ok, I just really like cheese. Please contact me at dworkin "AT" mcmaster "DOT" ca.

### Current Graduate students

**Katie Pelletier:** Is a Ph. D student interested in evolutionary genetics of complex phenotypes. Katie is identifying genetic variants influencing Drosophila wing size and shape within and between adaptively diverged populations. Katie plans to use this system to address questions about possible developmental and genetic biases that might influence the evolutionary process. Katie enjoys doing physical activities that inevitably lead to knee injuries.

**Tyler Audet:** Is a Ph.D student interested in the evolution of sexual size dimorphism and sexual conflict, using genomic approaches to address several fundamental questions. Tyler is using a variety of systems (artificial selection, experimental evolution and comparative approaches) within and among *Drosophila* species.

**Brandon McIntyre:** Is an M.Sc. student testing models to explain and predict genetic background dependence. Brandon uses the development of the *Drosophila* wing and its adult morphology as a model to test these models.

**Amanda Neves:** Amanda is currently an M.Sc. student who is using computational genomic approaches to investigate how variation in gene expression during development does (and does not) mediate phenotypic differences. Amanda is using RNAseq from developing wing tissues from *Drosophila*, investigating both natural variation among strains, and mutational effects.

**Arteen Torabi-Marashi:** Arteen is using genomic approaches (RNAseq and population genomics) to investigate how natural variation in gene expression and genetic variants under selection influencing Social Behaviour in *Drosophila*. Arteen is jointly supervised by Dr. Reuven Dukas.


### Current Undergraduate students (independent projects)

**Mariam Abass:** Does heat stress influence mutation rate in Drosophila?

**Brett Van Bakel:** Does natural variation in cell size influence mutational sensitivity to mutations in the *miniature* gene?

**Veronica Du:** Is there a parallel response on wing size and shape to temperature and hypoxia in Drosophila.

## Lab alumni

### Graduate students and Post-Doctoral Associates

**Dr. Andrew Scott:** was a Ph. D student (jointly supervised by Reuven Dukas and Ian Dworkin) studying the evolution of complex social behaviours including aggregation behaviour. Andrew used a combination of genetics, artificial selection and genomics to identify genes that contribute to variation for these social behaviours.


**Audrey Wilson:** Audrey completed her M.Scc, studying a potential mechanism that may contribute to the early evolution of sexually selected weapons, using experimental evolution in *Drosophila melanogaster*. By manipulating the spatial environment in specific ways, Audrey is determining the degree to which this can contribute to increased one-on-one contests for access to mates, and whether this in turn will increase sexual dimorphism of key traits. Because of the experiments that she did, Audrey's work space looked a lot like a craft store, and spent a considerable amount of time in the dollar store to find just the right materials to be converted to usable scientific "equipment".

**Darcy Henderson:** Darcy completed her M.Sc. studying the extent to which genetic interactions (epistasis) between pairs of mutations depends upon both how much the individual mutations perturb the phenotype (their magnitude) and the wild type genetic background in which the mutations are examined. When not setting up crosses, or hitting a puck, she likes watching controversial films and shows on netflix.


**Dr. Sarah Marzec:** Completed her Ph.D Student using Waddington's classic system studying genetic assimilation in *Drosophila melanogaster* to address questions about canalization, cryptic genetic variation and trait evolution by genetic assimilation. Sarah is secretly hoping for a small lab accident that will result in her getting superpowers.


**Dr. Maria Pesevski:** As a Ph.D student studied the evolution of condition dependence and sexual dimorphism for size and shape using *Drosophila* wing morphology. When not thinking deeply about size, shape and sexual differences in flies, Maria spends her time salsa dancing.


**Caitlyn Daley:** Caitlyn finished her M.Sc. in December 2019. Caitlyn studied the extent to which genetic background dependence of mutations were similar for mutations within and between genes throughout a gene regulatory network that influences *Drosophila* wing development. She really loves her cat.

**Paul Knoops:** Paul did his M.Sc. research studying how Drosophila interacted with potential predators, and how this influenced Drosophila mating behaviour and activity. Paul also made sure we never had any leftovers for lab parties.
