## Current people in the lab

<p class="about-text">
Ian Dworkin: Is an associate professor in the Department of Biology <a href= "https://www.biology.mcmaster.ca/ "> at McMaster University </a> Where our lab uses a variety of systems to address questions about how genetic and developmental mechanisms influence evolutionary processes, and how evolutionary history has shaped genetic and developmental mechanisms. When not doing the science thing, I do the dad thing. In the few spare moments, I also do some nerdy things (movies, video games, cooking, hiking). Favourite cheese is a really good Oka. Also old cheddar. And Jarslberg. Ok, I just really like cheese. Please contact me at dworkin "AT" mcmaster "DOT" ca.

<p class="about-text">
Sarah Marzec: Is a Ph.D Student who is using Waddington's classic system studying genetic assimilation in *Drosophila melanogaster* to address questions about canalization, cryptic genetic variation and trait evolution by genetic assimilation. Sarah's is secretly hoping for a small lab accident that will result in her getting superpowers.

<p class="about-text">
Maria Pesevski: Is a Ph.D student interested in the evolution of condition dependence and sexual dimorphism for size and shape using *Drosophila* wing morphology. When not thinking deeply about size, shape and sexual differences in flies, Maria spends her time salsa dancing.
</p>

<p class="about-text">
Katie Pelletier: Is a Ph. D student interested in evolutionary genetics of complex phenotypes. Katie is identifying genetic variants influencing Drosophila wing size and shape within and between adaptively diverged populations and plans to use this to address questions about possivle developmental and genetic biases that might influence the evolutionary process.
