I'm a father, scientist, nerd, teacher, metalhead, gamer, etc...

<span class="fa fa-flask about-icon"></span> 
Right now I'm a postdoc in <a href= "http://genaamics.org/">Annalise Paaby's lab</a> at <a href= "http://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech</a>  where I am studying <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=developmental+system+drift">Developmental System Drift</a> in nematodes within the Caenorhabditis genus. Ultimately, my goal is to understand how two species can achieve the same (conserved) phenotype even though their developmental mechanisms vary wildly.

<span class="fa fa-code about-icon"></span> 
I mostly write/code in <strong>R</strong> and <strong>BASH</strong>, but sometimes dabble in <strong>python</strong> and/or <strong>html</strong>, and whatever else seems interesting at the time. I used to use just about every flavor of linux (except redhat distros... gross), but ultimately settled down on an apple machine.

I have a dual Ph.D. in <a href="https://integrativebiology.natsci.msu.edu/">Integrative Biology</a> and <a href="https://eebb.msu.edu/">Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and Behavior</a> (EEBB) from <a href="http://www.msu.edu/">Michigan State University</a>, where I was lucky (cursed?) enough to be a part of two labs: <a href="https://www.lakeforest.edu/academics/faculty/shingleton/">Alex Shingleton</a> and <a href="http://www.biology.mcmaster.ca/dworkin/">Ian Dworkin</a>. There I worked on uncovering the developmental and molecular-genetic mechanisms of sexual size and shape dimorphism in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. I also got my B.A. in Biological Anthropology from <a href="www.pitt.edu">University of Pittsburgh</a>.

I also like to spend time with my <a href="/_freya">family</a>, and see live shows (mostly metal). See what I'm listening to, <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/Thorwegian">here</a>!
