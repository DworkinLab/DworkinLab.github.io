Finally migrating the lab website to github, so this stub of a post is mostly to check that things are working. I will be asking for comments soon, but not yet!

 The template for this website was [entirely based](https://github.com/testanick/testanick.github.io) on (i.e. stolen!) from Dr. Nick Testa, a previous Ph.D student in the lab, and now a bigwig data scientist in Pittsburgh.
