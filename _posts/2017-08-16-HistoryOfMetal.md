 So, I've been playing around with some data that I've been wanting to get my hands on for a while. As an avid metal enthusiast, I've always wondered which styles of metal were actually more popular, which countries were the most metal, etc... To answer these burning questions, I wrote a python script to scrape data from one of my more frequently visited sites: <a href= "https://www.metal-archives.com/">The Metal Archives</a>. In the end, I ended up using <a href= "https://github.com/MiguelSR/metal-scraper">this</a> script after all the work I put in. Oh well. 
 <br>
 <br>
  I ended up finding a lot of interesting trends, and some that were super obvious. I'll let you check out the data for yourself (below). I have things kind of annotated, so try to stick to the "History of Metal" tab. Also, I apologize for the slow loading times... bear with me
