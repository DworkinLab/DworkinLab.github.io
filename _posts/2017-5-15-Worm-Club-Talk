title: Worm Club Talk Today
tags: [updates, exciting-stuff]

Today is the day I give my first talk based on the research I'm doing in the Paaby Lab! 

I'll be presenting a talk called "The Shape of Things to Come: Developmental System Drift in Caenorhabditis Nematode Embryos" at Emory University. Worm clubs are apparently a thing that worm people do down here. 

Either way, I've got some really cool new preliminary data and I'm excited to get some good feedback. If you're sad that you missed the talk, feel free to message me so I can fill you in...
