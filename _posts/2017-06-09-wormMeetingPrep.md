As the annual <i>C. elegans</i> meeting rapidly approaches, I've been starting to think more about what it means to be a "worm person." A shift in model organism always comes with a shift in the sorts of questions people ask with said organisms. I've heard a lot about how different worm meetings are from other meetings I usually go to in terms of content, but really had no concrete idea of what to expect.  In my experience, worm people tend to be a lot more medically and biochemically oriented than I'm used to. 
<br><br>
I guess the proof is in the pudding (or... conference in this case).
<br><br>
But that doesn't have to be the case... why wait until the conference to figure out what sort of topics will be covered? Well, I started by sifting through the [Schedule of Events](http://www.genetics-gsa.org/celegans/2017/cgi-bin/celegans17soe.pl) and, while there do look like a lot of interesting talks, there also appear to be very few in my particular field. Five, specifically (though the Ecology and Evolution section is a little bigger than that). 
<br><br>
If you're curious what the distribution looks like, I made a pretty(ish) new plot (using Python and Tableau) to describe the primary and secondary sessions that people self-reported in their abstracts. <br>

<br><br>
And there you have it! Even though I'm in a pretty small minority, I'm really looking forward to getting to know the worm community a little better. Hopefully I come back with lots of exciting stories about worms (as much as one could hope for, anyway)...
